<h3>Setup Instructions</h3>

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:

```
2. Create a virtual environment using virtualenv. This will allow you to install the required Python packages for the project without affecting your global Python installation:

```bash
cd django-project
virtualenv env
```

3. Activate the virtual environment:

On Windows:

```bash
env\Scripts\activate.bat
```
On Linux/MacOS:

```bash
source env/bin/activate
```

4. Install the required packages using pip and the requirements.txt file:

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

5. Migrate the database:

```
python manage.py migrate
```

6. Start the development server:

```
python manage.py runserver
```
The server should now be running at <a href="http://127.0.0.1:8000/">http://127.0.0.1:8000/</a>
